    "Your hero doesn't think they are the best - they know they are. Winning isn't enough for your hero. They must completely dominate the opponent. Anytime there is even a shadow of a doubt as to who is better, they must humiliate the opponent. They are the kind of person who disarms an opponent in a duel just so they can pick up the revolver and hand it back with a smirk. Arrogant heroes tend to go for the 'boss' in battle, attacking lesser minions only if they get in the way.",
