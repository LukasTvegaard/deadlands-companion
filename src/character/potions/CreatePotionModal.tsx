// TODO: Remember to handle the power point restrictions,
// e.g: Don't allow creating a potion if the power's currentPowerPoints is lower than the potion's powerPointCost
// and don't allow creating a potion if this would cause the creator to have used more than half (rounded down) of their power points on potions.
